# eval_database
This is for a project for my English teacher

# It is used to graphically evaluate students based on his rubric
Written in PHP, Javascript and HTML. 

# Used a free, open source template called Hyperspace by HTML5 UP for the HTML and CSS. 
I wanted to teach myself coding in PHP. Enjoy cringing at my stupid PHP code :)
