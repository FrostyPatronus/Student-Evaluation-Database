2 Text fields, one for surname and other for given names

Is it possible for the student name to autofill under "Evaluate Students" when there is only one student left? Saves me two key strokes. Needs to make clear that when a "student does not exist" error occurs the end user is reminded to double check the block. 

Is it possible to add students and assignments directly from "Evaluate Students"? It is very annoying to input students twice for the first assignment. 

Touch is very laggy.
